# 🌸 My Cute 3D Room Project 🌸


Hello and welcome! 🎀  
This is my very first **3D project**, and I'm so excited to share it with you. It's a small cozy room in 3D where you can just relax, look around, and enjoy the vibe. ☕🛋️✨

## ✨ About This Project

This project is my first time working with:

- 🖥️ **Blender** - for creating 3D models  
- 🌐 **Three.js** - for bringing them to life on the web  

It has been a fun (and challenging 😅) learning experience. I made lots of mistakes, bugs, and errors... but I kept fighting through and learned so much! 💪

Most of the 3D models you see are made by me while practicing through an online course. Some super cute assets were added with proper credits — please check the credit section below. Huge thanks to all the amazing creators! 🙏

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
